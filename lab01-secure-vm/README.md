# Lab 01 â€“ Secure VM Deployment with Azure Bastion

## Objective

This lab demonstrates how to deploy a secure Azure Virtual Machine environment without exposing it to the public internet. The VM is accessible only through Azure Bastion. Diagnostic logging is enabled, and a system-assigned managed identity is configured. All traffic is controlled via NSG, and logging is sent to Log Analytics for auditing.

The purpose of this lab is to show how a hardened jump-host VM can be securely deployed in a controlled network environment using Azure-native services and access control patterns.s

## Scope

The following components are deployed:

- Virtual Network with two subnets:
  - `subnet-jumphost-01`
  - `AzureBastionSubnet` (required by Azure Bastion)
- Network Security Group (NSG) with deny-all-inbound by default
- Azure Bastion Host for browser-based RDP/SSH access
- Windows Server 2022 Virtual Machine
- Log Analytics Workspace
- System-assigned managed identity attached to VM
- Diagnostic settings enabled for the VM and NSG

## Resource Overview

| Resource Type        | Name                                       |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Resource Group       | `rg-secure-vm-01`                          |
| VNet                 | `vnet-core-weu01`                          |
| Subnets              | `subnet-jumphost-01`, `AzureBastionSubnet` |
| VM                   | `vm-jumphost-weu01`                        |
| NSG                  | `nsg-jumphost-01`                          |
| Bastion Host         | `bastion-core-weu01`                       |
| Log Analytics        | `log-core-weu01`                           |

Remember that a /27 subnet is required for Bastion

## Logging & Output

CLI deployment outputs are available in [`test-output.log`](test-output.log)

## Cleanup

To remove all deployed resources:

```bash
az group delete --name rg-secure-vm-01 --yes --no-wait
terraform destroy
```
