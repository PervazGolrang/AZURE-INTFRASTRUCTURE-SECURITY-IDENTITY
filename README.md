# Azure Infrastructure, Security, and Identity Lab Series

This repository provides a curated set of advanced hands-on lab projects focused on Azure infrastructure deployment, security hardening, hybrid connectivity, and enterprise-grade identity management. Each lab project is built with a realistic step-by-step approach using both the Azure portal and infrastructure-as-code (Bicep, ARM, and Terraform), as well as it includes professional documentation and visual walkthroughs.

## Objectives

- Build production-aligned Azure environments using industry best practices
- Reinforce AZ-104, AZ-500, and AZ-305 knowledge through practical application
- Demonstrate cloud engineering proficiency through design, deployment, and security
- Show a layered understanding of access control, policy enforcement, observability, and recovery

## Technologies and Services

- Azure Virtual Network, Bastion, NSG, UDR, DNS
- Azure Storage, Diagnostic Settings, Azure Monitor
- RBAC, Privileged Identity Management, Conditional Access, Defender for Cloud
- Azure Firewall, Azure Policy, Management Groups
- Web Application Firewall (WAF), Azure Front Door
- Log Analytics, Microsoft Sentinel, Identity Protection
- VPN Gateway, ExpressRoute, Hybrid DNS, Private Link, Application Gateway
- Entra ID (Azure AD), PIM, Access Reviews, App Proxy, SSO

## Labs Overview

### Project 01: Core Infrastructure & Security Foundations
A full secure infrastructure deployment, covering VM isolation, diagnostics, access security, identity hardening, network control, and Sentinel integration. Mainly built with the Azure Cloud Shell.

- Step 01: Secure VNet, NSG, VM Deployment with Bastion (no public IP)
- Step 02: Private Storage Account with Logging and Firewalls
- Step 03: RBAC and Privileged Identity Management
- Step 04: UDR and Custom DNS Forwarders
- Step 05: Landing Zone with Azure Firewall and Policies
- Step 06: Zero Trust Web App with Azure Front Door and WAF
- Step 07: Log Analytics and Microsoft Sentinel Alerting

### Project 02: Advanced Enterprise Infrastrucure
A hybrid cloud architecture integrating multi-region deployment, private DNS, secure connectivity (VPN/ExpressRoute), and high-availability practices. Includes modern governance using Azure Policy and Template Specs, with cost enforcement and monitoring automation.

- Step 01: Governance Framework (Policy, Tags, and Cost Controls with Template Specs)
- Step 02: Hybrid Connectivity (VPN Gateway and ExpressRoute with IPsec Routing)
- Step 03: Identity Bridge with Entra Connect, Seamless SSO, and Conditional Access
- Step 04: Highly Available Web Application Deployment
- Step 05: Network Virtual Appliance (NVA), UDR, and Custom Routing
- Step 06: Monitoring, Alerts, Dashboards, and Automated Remediation

### Project 03: Enterprise Identity & Conditional Access
A Zero Trust-aligned identity architecture focused on secure authentication, least-privilege access, external collaboration control, workload identity protection, and advanced analytics. All configurations follow Microsoft-recommended best practices, fully deployed using Bicep.

(Coming soon - documented in full once Project 02 is finalized.)

## Intended Audience

This repository was mainly built for testing my knowledge, however, it also is intended for students preparing for the Microsoft AZ-104, AZ-500, and AZ-305 exams, as well as engineers and professionals with roles in Azure infrastructure, cloud security, or hybrid cloud design.

## Requirements

- Azure subscription with Contributor or Owner access
- Azure CLI and Terraform CLI installed locally
- Bicep CLI or Azure CLI with native Bicep support
- Basic familiarity with PowerShell or Bash
- Budget of â‚¬15. (**Remember to cleanup**, Bastion and Azure Firewall is very expensive)
